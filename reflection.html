            <p> Freshman year was probably one of the weirdest school years of my life. With Covid-19 going around and everyone in a panic, I spent more than half the year online. Online school didn’t really affect me though, as I didn’t mind doing schoolwork online. Meeting new people was the hardest thing to do, and I found it very annoying because it was freshman year, and I wanted to meet new people. The best way to meet new people was through exploration, which is where I met most of my new friends.</p>
            <p> Exploratory was fun and exciting as I wanted to explore and see the shops here at Old Colony. When I came here, I knew I wanted to do computer science, but I was open to new things if I were to enjoy something else. The first exploratory I went through was all over the place. It seemed that they were trying to get ready as the school year had started late, and they needed to get it going. Because it was early in the school year, a lot of things were still out of commission, and we didn’t get to do as much as other people who would have ended up going through it later on. Though it was very hectic, it felt right because it was just like the setting of a real restaurant. It ended up being my second pick for the shop.</p>
            <p> I had finally gotten to Computer Science where I met my friend Brea. We goofed around though we still got our work done and it was a lot of fun. After going through, I knew this was the shop that I wanted. Creating websites and programs are things that I had always wanted to do since I was a kid. Skipping forward, I was getting great grades in all my academic classes, and I had gotten into the Computer Science Shop! I was very happy, as were my parents because I had gotten my first pick for the shop.</p>
            <p> Sophomore year was fun and more normal than freshman year was. We were fully in person this year and we ended up not having to wear masks around halfway through the year. It felt weird at first, but I was able to feel normal again after a while. Academics-wise school wasn’t all that difficult this year. Math is usually my hardest subject, and Geometry wasn’t that hard to understand, unlike Algebra II last year. ELA was actually very interesting and fun this year with the weird prompts Mrs. Weeden would give us. Because they were so different and broad, I was able to write about and make claims about things nobody has probably thought about, as you can’t really be wrong as long as you provide evidence. History was relatively interesting this year as well, and I enjoyed learning about it.</p>
            <p> Shop was really fun this year as I got to make my projects more user interactive and customizable. I attended States SkillsUSA in web design, and it was fun, although it was really weird and unorganized to the point where it was unfair between teams. We also took a Javascript course this year, which I was able to get far in and learn JQuery, which is even easier to use than Javascript is and has lots more capabilities. It is insanely nice to be able to use JavaScript to get your websites to work better and provide more user activity. As an example, Trevor and I recreated Wordle and renamed it TorBle with different things the user can do with a menu with different modes and such. The final AP Computer Science test seemed to be hard with the questions we were being given and the practice tests that we were using, but when we finally got there, it was pretty easy besides a few questions in my opinion. I feel pretty confident about that test, and I did really well on the related final exam as well.</p>
            <p> All in all, sophomore year was mostly fun, though it took some adapting to get back into normality. It was pretty relaxed too as the stuff we were learning wasn’t difficult to learn and was stuff I could understand easily. This year was interesting and although it’s still hard for me to believe it, I look forward to being a junior next year.</p>
            <p> Junior year was a weird yet fun year as I experienced what it was like to be an upperclassman for the first time. I had always thought when I was a kid that being a Junior/Senior was extraordinarily superb and that they must already be adults, but now that I am here it doesn’t feel that way. In a way, I still feel like a kid, wanting to hang out with my friends, stay up, and complain about school and why it's unbelievably bad. Thinking about it though, I have matured enough to consider time and get everything done that needs to be done whilst still balancing the fun in my life. Because of my life decisions, at the end of the year this year, I am passing with the highest honors, even though I still got to enjoy the year playing video games, destroying the rest of the shop in spike ball, and sleeping in. </p>
            <p>This year I received my license and, in turn, was able to drive to school in the mornings. This drastically changed my sleeping schedule for the better as I was able to stay up later while also being able to wake up later. This allowed me to stress less over schoolwork as I got more time to myself both in the morning and at night. This also allowed me to put more time into things I didn’t fully understand before going to school the next morning. This was especially important for Honors Pre-Calculus with Mrs. Gamlin. Taking that class this year was hard as it wasn’t as clean-cut as my other classes. I was learning about things I didn’t fully understand and things that would take me multiple nights to half-grasp so that I could get good grades on the tests. Although this might sound awful, it was a really fun experience that taught me a lot about having to study and how I can’t just understand everything first try, which I had felt before.</p>
            <p>My other classes, Physics, Modern World History, and English, weren’t much of a challenge for me this year, and I was able to do well in those classes by just turning everything in on time. There wasn’t really anything I didn’t understand in those classes which made it easier for me to keep up with the Pre-Calculus. Shop this year was fun with our new teacher Mr. Riley. At first, I really didn’t want a new teacher because I had already grown to like Mrs. Soucy but after a while, I started to enjoy him being our teacher. He used his prior experience in making games and coding to teach us how to code using practical standards that are used in the real world, even though sometimes I questioned them. We also learned a new programming language, Java, which happens to be my favorite language now besides web design languages.</p>
            <p>Shop wasn’t at all hard this year as I understood coding from the years prior and the only real thing we were learning this year was the syntax for Java. There were times though when I would get into my head and almost forget what I was doing and in these moments I felt what I was coding was impossible to finish and would get stuck on something that I shouldn’t be stuck on. I learned this year that sometimes I just have to look away from my code and come back later to get a better look at what I need to be doing and the best way to do it. Overall, this year was probably my favorite year at Old Colony so far as I’ve made what I think to be many life-long friendships both in my shop and across other shops. I also believe I didn’t struggle as much this year as I did last year as I was able to relax and knew that as long as I was trying my best, I would get good grades and be fine. I created many memories with teachers, friends, and family this year that I will never forget, and I look forward to seeing what it is like to be a Senior next year.</p>
            <p>Senior year though, at the start, was very mediocre when it comes to academics. I have some very hard classes as well as some extremely easy classes that I have to balance. I found myself being stressed out in the beginning of the year, but I learned how to balance my time between friends, work, and self-time. I was also accepted into Johnson & Wales with a merit scholarship of $27,000, as well as UMass Dartmouth with a merit scholarship of 5,000. I also got the Abigail Adams Scholarship totaling another 1.4k per year for any state school. The scholarships and acceptances prove to me that the four years I worked hard in high school paid off, and I can kind of lay back and relax now.</p>
            <p>I learned more about user interfaces using JavaFX, which allowed me to level up my programming skills and my programs. I also learned about SQL and databases. This allowed me to be able to incorporate SQL into my Java programming making my programs easier to read/write, being able to access data outside of Java. We also stuck to doing web design with HTML and CSS, and I’ve improved in those areas as well. I’m now able to use all of the skills I have learned to express my creativity onto different projects / web pages. I’ve been hanging out with my friends I made in shop and in academics outside of school and now know they will more than likely be lifelong friends. Overall, my Old Colony experience was very good and I enjoyed it, though I cannot wait to leave and head to college.</p>
