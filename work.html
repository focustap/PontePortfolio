            <p>This year, we focused on essential Python concepts, such as the print function, floats, ints, and variables, making coding more organized and readable. We explored the import function, incorporating external modules like random and math. Delving into Booleans, if-else statements, functions, and loops enhanced our ability to structure and execute code effectively. Additionally, we grasped the significance of arrays for data storage.</p>
                <p>In web design, we covered headings, paragraphs, and image importing, utilizing CSS for cohesive website construction. Linking to other pages or external sites became familiar, followed by incorporating audio and video files. Margins were employed for efficient page arrangement. Self-learning included basic JavaScript coding for website functionality, and ongoing exploration of flexboxes for improved page organization.

            <p>In here we learned about how to keep ourselves safe from online attackers and help combat them. I don’t remember everything we learned but I’ll put down what stuck with me. We learned about how hackers target people and why and we also learned the vocabulary for the different types of attacks they do.</p>
                <p>We learned about why hackers hack in the first place whether it's for money, for example ransomware, or because they want to take out a business. Even then they usually are doing it for money. We also learned about how we could stop those attacks using virus scanners. On top of learning about what we could do, we learned about what big companies do. They encrypt all their data in many different ways, like hashing and salting, which is a one way encryption. This means that you can’t decrypt it using the same key. But somehow mathematically, someone has a key that can decrypt the encrypted data and use it.</p>
                <p>We also learned about how businesses handle being attacked. Sometimes instead of spending 15 thousand dollars to fix a liability, they’ll let it get hacked or destroyed in order to pay less money for it in the long run. Of course this won’t happen if the liability is very important like it’s everyone's passwords and logins. We also started learning about how companies manage all of their assets and how they are able to protect them.</p>

            <p>To start off this project I wanted to come up with a color theme for the website that fit One Republic. When I looked up One Republic and clicked on images, a lot of their photos were black and white so I went with a black and white website. The cool thing about them though is that they love to splash tons of color on top of the black and white a lot of the time, so that's what my idea was with the website. I next created all the HTML pages and named them so I knew I had everything I needed. To start off the coding I created the header with all of the hyperlinks to the other pages. I was then able to copy and paste that code to each page so that it was easy. After that I did the footer which would also be on every page. It was a white background saying that the page was funded and created by the company, “Up Sell”. This was also when I created some CSS to make it look pretty and make sure that the button you last clicked (the page you were on) looked different so that you knew where you were on the site. </p>
              <p>I worked on the homepage first because it was the easiest and came up with my own definition of One Republic and put it at the bottom of the page with a nice picture of the band in the front. The second page I finished was the Discography so that I could get it out of the way. I had to go through all the albums the band had made and list the songs with the album cover for those songs. I used ordered lists for the songs and had headers for each album announcing what the album was called. The third page I worked on was the band members because it was easy. I went online and found what each member did and did headers, pictures, and little paragraphs about what they did for the band. It gets the point across immediately and is easy to follow. The fourth page I worked on was the visual page that had six music videos from youtube of the bands songs. It also had headings of the song titles. The last page I did was the hyperlinks page that had a table set up with all the links to pages I used to create the website. The links include the websites I used to find the band info and the pictures that I used along the whole website.</p>
              <p>After the pages were finished, I went to work with the CSS. I was also doing CSS while making the pages so that the pages didn’t look weird but this is when I started making everything look better and more presentable. The first thing I started working on was a little animated header so that the page really popped. Pink was one of those colors that was associated with One Republic so I decided to make a pink neon sign that almost looked out of order. I thought this was a good idea because the band is almost like a club band with the songs they make and the header represented that by looking like one of those signs you would see on the windows of a club. I then went to the Discography page and created a little animation that made it seem like the images were floating. Afterwards I went back to that same color scheme of black, white, and pink and put what looked like a pink glow coming from behind the images. Things like this I feel keep people on your website and want to keep using it. It adds surprise and makes the website less boring than it usually would be and I really enjoy making people wonder how something I did works. I also created a mini animation in-between pages where the page will fade out and then fade back in as the other page. This needed a little javascript but it wasn’t too difficult. What it did was it would run as the page loaded/unloaded and it would apply a class to the page making it appear to fade out/in. These were created using CSS animation which uses keyframes to change how something looks or the position of it gradually, making it look like it’s moving/transforming. All in all, my DDM came out pretty good and I’m proud of how it turned out. If I had more time I would have probably added more things to make it stand out though it looks great as it is now.</p>

            <p>        TorBle is a wordle-like game that was created by Trevor St. Amand and I. We coded it entirely using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We had the idea for our private project because we didn’t think it would be too difficult to remake but it instead was decently hard. What we had to do first was the HTML and set up the divs with similar IDs except for the number gradually went up by one. We then were able to find the wordle index and we put it into an array and we used that array to pick random words and split them by each letter. We then wrote code to compare the first letter of the picked word and the first letter of the guessed word and then do the same thing with each letter and either turn it green if correct, yellow if the letter is not in the right spot or gray if not in the word at all. We also ended up making the keyboard out of divs and corresponding the ids of the divs to the alphabet so that we could find what index number the letter was and take that number and pick the div in the keyboard and set it to the correct color on the keyboard to see what letters you have chosen better.</p>
            <p>We also have a dropdown menu that will have different modes for the Wordle game. Right now we just have a dark mode that will invert the colors on the screen so that everything is darker and corresponds to the darker colors. We are looking to create an insane mode where you get thirty seconds to answer the word and you see how many you can get right in a row before the timer runs out. We also want to do more things to make it more unlike wordle and more our own game.</p>

            <p>IFTTT is a public web service that allows you to have creative control and automated interactions between various cloud-based services like Twitter, Instagram, Dropbox, and more. The interactions between the services are considered IFTTT because it means “If this, then that”.</p>
                <p>What we did during this lab with IFTTT was we set up the raspberry pi’s with a light sensor to sense when the light was high and when the light was low. What we did with IFTTT was we set it up so that when the light reached a certain threshold it would log the sunset in your google calendar. This showed us how you can use sensors and do things over the internet with the results of those sensors and although it didn't show how powerful this can be, the things you can do with those sensors and the internet are almost infinite.</p>
                <p>We only used the raspberry pi and the google calendar but the IFTTT service has lots more than just that. I was looking around it and I saw things like Dominoes and the Apple App store and I can only imagine creating something that orders Dominoes for you at a certain time of day or temperature. All in all I don’t think there are many limitations on what you can do online and with a raspberry pi even with the things IFTTT does not have because you can always code what you need yourself if you really wanted to.</p>

            <p>BShop is probably the most proud I am of any of the websites I have made thus far. It is a clothing e-store that shows pictures of my shop friends in different clothes, and other clothes that are available to buy. I took inspiration from Shein when I made the website, and it looks really good.</p>
               <p> One of the hardest things when making a website with HTML code, CSS, and JavaScript is getting it to look professional, and not like it was made by a kid. I think I was able to accomplish this with this website as it looks like it could really be a clothing store. I use different types of styling to make it appear new and modern, with things not being exactly centered on the screen and text having weird shadows to make it point out and look nice on the screen. Overall the website is really good and is my favorite website to date.</p>

            <p>The breakout game we made is just like regular breakout, where the ball is thrown up when you click space and you have to break all of the blocks. The game also has a powerup you can collect to gain more lives. It changes colors when powerups are collected and you win when you break all the blocks.</p>
                <p>This game was one of the first ones we made and it helped me figure out how game developers think when they create games. For example, we made the walls slanted slightly downwards behind the scenes so that the ball wouldn’t ever get caught in an infinite loop going back and forth off the walls. This on top of learning how rigid body’s work for collisions with the powerups/ball helped for future games using Unity.

            <img src="images/junior/juniorDDM.png" alt="DDM">
            <p>I was able to use the Java that I was taught this year to accomplish this DDM using 2D arrays, ArrayLists, Classes, Files, and more. The DDM was to simulate a crossword puzzle using the console in Java under some requirements that were given. Some of the things that were asked for were lackluster so some of the code seems forced and I think it could look a lot better if I were to fully do this the way I envisioned it. I was able to meet most of the requirements given but due to lack of time, some of them aren’t able to be fulfilled.</p>
              <p>The Java program contains five classes and a text file that is being read from in the File Handler. There is a Clue class that contains all of the information for each word provided in the text file. It is using the data grabbed from the File Handler in order to find this data and then provide it to the other classes. There is also the Square class which only contains the char inside of an array that is used to populate the char array used. Here this class seems useless but if the program were to be expanded upon it would be nice to be able to store more things inside of the class. The second to last class, the Main class contains the loops and User Interface to use all of the methods from the Crossword class. </p>
              <p>The Crossword class is where most of the big methods are that control the bulk of the program. Here, I used three 2D arrays to figure out most of the calculations to check if the user had completed the crossword. Two of the arrays are char arrays, one being the user’s array and the other being a completely finished array. The finished array is filled out using the Square array, the third array, which got all of its information from the words provided in the text file. To check if the user is correct when submitting the crossword, it compares the two arrays and checks to ensure each index is the same. If it is, it congratulates the user and tells them that they won. Otherwise, it will tell the user they lost and end the program.</p>
              <p>Looking back, I think I should have sent the user back into the loop if they messed up the crossword instead of ending the program and having them lose their progress which wouldn’t be a hard fix. I also think instead of coding the numbers into the first position of the word it could’ve been to the side to avoid confusion on what number each word was once they had filled in the word.. There is also the “problem” where if you erase a word that crosses another word it will delete the letter that is within the other word. This could be looked at as a feature as you are deleting the word, but I think I could fix this issue by storing each and every word that has been guessed and their indexes and keeping them true whilst they are not guessing that particular word number. I could then use that data to make sure those indexes aren’t changed during the erasing process. Overall this program isn’t my best work but it does what it is supposed to do and provides the experience that it was supposed to provide.</p>

            <p>My Monopoly game was made in JFX where I use an SQL Database to store information about the board as well as save different games for players that can be loaded. I use scene switching as well as a Utils class to keep everything organized and keep static methods for the database in their own class. A Cells class keeps track of the different places on the board and their data, getting this information from a database. The BoardController class will handle all of the actions the player makes such as turns, button presses, purchases, etc, and send this information to the correct class to be updated. The Player class will keep IDs of all the players as well as their data such as money and owned properties. In the game the player has $2500, can move around the board, buy property, and gain money when other people land on their property. The UI on the right will keep track of the player's information(money and properties, etc). 
              If I were to continue working on this in the future, I would add the functionality for Community Chest / Chance cards as well as properties to make the game more like the original. Working on this project has allowed me to learn about new things I can implement in other programs such as animation in JavaFX. I now have different methods in my GitHub that I can reuse/rely on when/if I ever plan on animating anything in JFX in the future. Some other things I learned about are the use of enums on JFX. I thought they only existed in Unity, but found ways to utilize them in my Monopoly program to keep track of different cell types. I also learned from Mr. Riley’s feedback 
              that you can put a function inside of an enum, isn’t that interesting!
